See DataLab [roadmap page](https://datalab-platform.com/en/contributing/roadmap.html) for future and past milestones.

## sigima 0.3.0 ##

💥 New features and enhancements:

* New image processing features:
  * Added new "Gaussian frequency filter" feature:
    * This feature allows to filter an image in the frequency domain using a Gaussian filter.
    * It is implemented in the `sigima.proc.image.freq_fft` function.

* New signal processing features:
  * Added "Brickwall frequency filter" feature:
    * This feature allows to filter a signal in the frequency domain using a brickwall filter.
    * It is implemented in the `sigima.proc.signal.freq_fft` function, among the other frequency domain filtering features that were already available (e.g., `Bessel`, `Butterworth`, etc.).
  * Enhanced zero padding to support prepend and append. Change default strategy to next power of 2.

* New I/O features:
  * Added support for FT-Lab signal and image format.
